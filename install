                    EduMIPS64 Installation notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

System requirements
-------------------
EduMIPS64 requires the Java Runtime Environment version 5 or later.


Running the program
-------------------
EduMIPS64 is distributed in two ways:
	- Source distribution
	- Jar distribution

If you've got the .jar distribution, you simply have to run the
program. On most systems, double-clicking on the icon of the .jar file
should be enough to let you run the program. If this fails, run from a
command shell the command

	java -jar edumips64-VERSION.jar

Where VERSION is the edumips64 version that you are using.

If you've got the source distribution, before running it you must build
the .jar file. This requires the Java Development Kit 5 or later and 
the Ant tool.
From a command shell, run the command

	ant

After that, you'll get the .jar file, and you can run it.

If you want you can use the makefile, but it's unmantained and it could
not work.

Enjoy EduMIPS64!!

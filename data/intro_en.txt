INTRODUCTION
============

EduMIPS64 is a MIPS64 instruction set simulator, born thanks to the efforts of a 
bunch of Computer Engineering students at the University of Catania.

It looks exactly like WinMIPS64, and its concept is almost the same, but 
EduMIPS64 isn't simply a WinMIPS64 clone.

There are some features, like Dinero integration, localization, portability, GUI 
customizability, that aren't present in WinMIPS64.

EduMIPS64 uses a 5-stages pipeline:

IF  - Istruction Fetch
ID  - Istruction Decode
EX  - Execute
MEM - Memory
WB  - Write Back

For more info, please take a look at the other manual sections.

HAPPY CODING!!
